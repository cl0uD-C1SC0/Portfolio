Storage Classes Type:
    # Frequently Accessed Objects
        - Standard: The default storage class. Highly durable, highly available with millisecond access to data
        
        - REDUCED_REDUNDANCY: Similitar to STANDARD but with less durability because data is not replicated
        as many times. Designed for noncritical, reproducible data 
            ** NOT RECOMMENDED as it comes at a higher cost than STANDARD 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Infrenquently Accessed Objects 
        - STANDARD_IA (Infrenquant Access): Highly durable, highly available, with milisecond latancy. Minimum
        billable object size of 128KB and 30 day retention time. Lower fee than STANDARD but you are charged a retrieval/revivel fee 

        - ONEZONE_IA: Highly durable with millisecond latancy. Minimum billable object size of 128KB and 30 day retention
        time with a revivel free. Data is only stored in a single availability zone and therefore is less available than STANDARD_IA, however
        the sotrage fee is also Lower

    # Rarely Accessed Objects
        - GLACIER: A Hihgly durable, cheap storage class designed for archive data where a portion needs to be retrievable
        in minutes. Has a minimum billable storage time of 90 days; Data is not available in real-time and instead
        must be restored.

        - DEEP_ARCHIVE: A highly durable, extremely cheap storage class designed for archival or rarely accessed data. Has a 
        minimum billable storage time of 180 days. Data is not available in real-time and instead can be restored (within hours)

    # Moving Data Between Storage Classes - Intelligent Tiering

        -> INTELLIGENT_TIERING
                    * Is a storage class that automatically moves data between frequent access tiers and infrequent access tiers
                    * I.E. Objects that have not been accessed for 30 days are moved from frequent to infrenquent access
                * Helps to optimise storage costs:
                    -> Note: No retrieval/revival fee is charged for objects accessed in the infrequent access tiers but there is
                    small charge per object for movement into this tier. 

                * Objects MUST be larger than 128KB to be automatically transitioned between the tiers
                * Perfect for long-lived data that has unpredictable access patterns.

        -> Lifecycle Policies
                    * Allow objects to transition between the storage classes
                    * A set of rules that S3 applies to a group of objects
                    * Transition Rules: Define when objects move to another storage class 
                    * I.E. Move from STANDARD -> STANDARD_IA after 60 days 
                    * Expiration Rules: Define when objects expire (i.e are deleted)
                    * Ideal for objects that have a dfined lifecycle
                            Exemple of Objects: Logs file.
