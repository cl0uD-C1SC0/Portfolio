What Are ACL's 
    * Access Control List are XML resource policies used to grant access on both buckets and objects
    * Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as a sub-resource that defines the permissions 
    * The default ACL grants the resource owner full control over the object

ACL Features

    * Cannot grant permissions to individual users
    * Can only grant basic read/write permissions
    * Cannot grant conditional access

            (Arquivo: Defined.XML)

    -> Owner shows the <ID> element which is the account owner (expressed as their canocial ID)
    -> Grant shows the <Grantee> element that is either the AWS account or predefined group the
    permission will be granted to and the <Permission>

    Canned ACL's:

            aws s3 cp me.jpg s3://acloudguru/images/public --acl public-read
            aws s3 cp me2.jpg s3://acloudguru/images/public --acl public-read --profile wildguru --region eu-west-1
            aws s3 cp me3.jpg s3://aclouduguru/images/public --acl authenticated-read --profile wildguru --region e-west-1
