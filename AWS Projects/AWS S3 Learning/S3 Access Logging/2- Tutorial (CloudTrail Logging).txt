"CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by recording API calls made
on your account. CloudTrail records important information about each API call,
including the name of the APi, the identity of the caller, the time of the API call, the
request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWs service.
This information helps you to track changes made to your AWS resource and to
troubleshoot operational issues." 

CloudTrail S3 Logging: 
        * Enabled when you switch on CloudTrail
        * Captures specific APi calls made to S3 from your AWS account
            * By default only supported bucket-level actions are captured
            * Object level actions can be added by configuring an event selector
            * Ideal for compliance and auditing
