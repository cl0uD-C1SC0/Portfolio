This finding informs you of attempts to run AWS API operations from a host outside of EC2, using temporary AWS credentials 
that were created on an EC2 instance in your AWS account. 
This means your EC2 instance has been compromised, and the temporary credentials from the instance have been exfiltrated to a remote host outside of AWS.
